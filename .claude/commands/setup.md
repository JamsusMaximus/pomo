description: Set up development environment
---

Set up the complete Pomo development environment:

1. Check prerequisites (Node.js 20+, pnpm)
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
4. Guide me through setting up Clerk (authentication)
5. Guide me through setting up Convex (backend)
6. Run `pnpm run verify-setup` to validate
7. Run `pnpm run dev` to start servers

Walk me through each step with clear instructions, wait for confirmation before moving to the next step.
